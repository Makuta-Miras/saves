			`You meet Tomek and Freya at the spaceport, and the entire Council quickly convenes. Alondo outlines the results of your diplomatic mission, which he believes has been a success. "There is one other thing," he says. "The Syndicate informed us that the Republic has Katya in custody, accused of terrorism."`
			`	The news is a shock to everyone. "I had begun to worry that was the case," says Freya.`
			`	"Why have they not announced it publicly?" asks Tomek.`
			`	"I suspect it's because they know she is innocent," says Alondo. "They say it is impossible to tell a lie to the Questioners, and in this case that will work in her favor."`
			`	You talk for a while longer, and then Tomek says, "Meet me in the spaceport when you are ready for your next assignment. Also, the Council approved a bonus for you." He gives you 200,000 credits.`

			`As you are landing on Poisonwood, Alondo explains, "Three decades ago, this was a slave colony. The Navy was responsible for liberating them, and they still feel a deep debt to the Republic as a result. But even if they do not join us, we can maybe establish more friendly relations with them."`
			"	Soon after you land, the governor of Poisonwood sends an aide to escort you to her office. The governor is a woman probably in her late fifties, and as you are speaking the sunlight occasionally catches her face or arms at exactly the right angle to show the faint, criss-crossing lines of very old scars. She must be one of the slaves who was freed by the Navy."
			`	As soon as you are seated, she says, "Now, I don't want to give you false hope. We will not be joining the Free Worlds."`
			`	"Understood," says Alondo. "We've come primarily to assure you that the Free Worlds will never attempt to take control of a planet that has not willingly chosen to join us. But without our support, your world is isolated and vulnerable."`
			`	"Indeed," she says, grimacing. They talk for a while, but it is clear she does not think her people would ever support even a treaty of neutrality with the "rebellion." Finally, she changes the subject. "Captain <last>," she says, "what do you believe is the greatest threat that humanity faces today?"`

That is a danger the Syndicate does face. but I find myself more concerned with certain threats that are closer to home."`
				goto 7
			label 4
			`	She seems surprised. "Not many in your generation would say that," she says. "Even here on Poisonwood, where we ought to know better, many of those who were born after the days of slavery think the Alphas are no more than a myth, a story that Parliament uses to justify maintaining such a large Navy."`

And that is the threat that weighs most heavily on my mind."`

			`	"I was a teenage slave working in the factories at the time," she says. "Exactly the wrong age, as it turned out. One day the overseers informed us that all the eighteen year old girls had to have mandatory 'health checkups' that day. I won't describe what the 'checkup' involved, but it was bewildering and unpleasant. And nearly all those girls disappeared, that day. They never returned from the 'checkups.' Only a few of us were left behind. Most of the leftovers were girls who had been unlucky enough to already be pregnant at that age. Or lucky, as it turned out. But I didn't understand why they didn't take me."`
			`	Alondo seems very disturbed by the story. "They were selling girls into prostitution?" he says.`
			`	"That's what we assumed," she says, "but there were dozens of girls like me who were not taken, even though we were not pregnant. It didn't make sense. Anyway, somehow news of that event got off-world and not long after, the Navy came in massive numbers, destroyed the slaver fleets and liberated our planet. In the process, they tried to invade an underground facility up in the mountains, which is where they thought the girls were being kept. But the facility was rigged to self-destruct, and they never found out what had been going on inside the facility. No one inside it survived."`

			`	"My parents said it was because I was so willful and stubborn, too hard to control," she says. "But years later, we began to discover that all of us who were passed over had one thing in common. We were all infertile. Had been already, the day of the Disappearance. Which means that either a bunch of pirates had suddenly decided they wanted to leave behind their lives of crime and settle down and raise families... or those girls were being used as incubators."`
			`	Alondo says, "I hear that was common during the Alpha wars. Alpha genetics were so unstable, they needed hundreds of test subjects to produce a handful of viable Alpha babies. Those were evil days."`
			`	"Days that may yet return," she says. "Somewhere, maybe even nearby on Bloodsea or Greenrock or Albatross, the remnants of the Alphas may still be hiding. Creatures bred to be strong and clever and able to kill without a hint of remorse. And now that this sector of space is yours, the duty of defending against them becomes yours, as well. That is why I agree to talk with you: to warn you of that reality."`
			`	You and Alondo return to your ship with one more thing for the fledgling Free Worlds to worry about. "I guess now we should return to Longjump and report to the Council," he says.`

		description "Ingot is a volcanic moon, totally unsuitable for life but rich in metal. The miners who work here must spend all their time inside pressurized buildings. Because Ingot has almost no atmosphere to slow them down, meteorites are a constant danger to the colonists. The shells of the buildings have multiple layers, designed to be self-sealing in any but the largest of impacts. Most of the mining is done remotely by robotic vehicles, but someone still needs to be present to control them and to make repairs when something goes wrong."

		description "New Wales is home to a few mining outposts which extract and refine rare earth minerals and heavy metals. It is dangerous work: the mines are deep underground and prone to noxious gases and cave-ins, and the refineries work with molten radioactive materials and caustic chemicals. Due to the somewhat dim light of the star Algorel, and the cloudiness of the atmosphere, this is not a good world for farming, and the population remains quite small."

The few settlements that have been built here were developed for mining sapphires and rubies; the sapphires found in New Austria range from blue to yellow to black to clear in color, and are used both for industrial abrasives and for jewelry."

		description "The mining outpost is swarming with Navy guards; they seem to have turned this moon into a temporary base of operations. The mine has been shut down, and no one is being allowed in or out of the mining outpost. It is not clear whether the miners are prisoners, or merely under a very tight watch."

		spaceport "The spaceport is built on a large island, a now-extinct volcano with an elevation of several kilometers at its center. Most of the large-scale fishing here is done by a single company, Poseidon Industries, who also built and maintain the spaceport. Steep winding roads and sturdy cement homes and warehouses line the mountain slopes, and below you in the harbor several massive trawling vessels are moored. On the outskirts of the spaceport are the ramshackle houses and open-air marketplace used by the smaller, independent fishing families."

		description "About a decade ago, a mining corporation from Zug planted a colony on Clink for harvesting some rare earth minerals that are present in this moon's crust due to its unusually high rate of asteroid impacts. The atmosphere here is too thin to breathe without a respirator, and because of the low gravity, the dust raised by the mining operations hangs perpetually in the air."
		description "The miners who work here are a tight-knit group, since most of them were part of the original colonization team. They are not particularly open to outsiders, and the facilities here are so rudimentary that they do not even stock fuel for visiting ships."
