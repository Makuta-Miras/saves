			`As you land, Alondo says to you, "Let me do the talking, please." You are met almost immediately by two men in suits, who escort you to a room in the Syndicate headquarters. Six men are sitting on one side of a large mahogany conference table; they gesture for the two of you to be seated on the other side.`
			`	You introduce yourselves. "Thank you for meeting with us," says Alondo.`
			`	"We are always open to new business opportunities," says one of the men, "although negotiating with known terrorists is... distasteful." He leafs through a folder of papers, pulls one out, and slides it over to you. It is a picture of Katya, and the caption under it reads, "Terrorist ringleader captured in raid on Kornephoros system." It is dated a few days after the Navy's initial assault, before you retook the system from them.`

"I am willing to believe you were hunting the terrorists, because I am aware through my own sources that the Free Worlds secured the services of a certain Ijs Springborn, whose skills would be well suited to such a hunt. And who might not be alive today if you had not given him a reason to leave this sector of space, where he is... universally despised. Regardless, we cannot sell weapons to enemies of the Republic."`
			`	"Piracy is on the rise in the Dirt Belt," says Alondo. "And I know you have customers there. Such as the Tarazed Corporation. If we can count you among our friends, we could ensure that your convoys reach Tarazed unmolested."`
			`	"And you would no doubt immediately purchase said weapons from Tarazed," says the man.`
			`	An older man sitting next to him says, "Of course, such weapons would end up being bought at a significant price markup." He is grinning.`
			"	You speak for a while longer, but Alondo manages to hash out a deal where the Free Worlds will defend any Syndicate ships they encounter in return for a promise that the Syndicate will not serve as Republic mercenaries and will not prevent you from purchasing their equipment indirectly through Tarazed. Additionally, the Syndicate's new fighter will be made available at Tarazed Shipyards at such time that the Free Worlds requires them. You thank the Syndicate leaders, and return to your ship."

		description "Ingot is a volcanic moon, totally unsuitable for life but rich in metal. The miners who work here must spend all their time inside pressurized buildings. Because Ingot has almost no atmosphere to slow them down, meteorites are a constant danger to the colonists. The shells of the buildings have multiple layers, designed to be self-sealing in any but the largest of impacts. Most of the mining is done remotely by robotic vehicles, but someone still needs to be present to control them and to make repairs when something goes wrong."

	planet "New Wales"
		description "New Wales is home to a few mining outposts which extract and refine rare earth minerals and heavy metals. It is dangerous work: the mines are deep underground and prone to noxious gases and cave-ins, and the refineries work with molten radioactive materials and caustic chemicals. Due to the somewhat dim light of the star Algorel, and the cloudiness of the atmosphere, this is not a good world for farming, and the population remains quite small."
		description "The Republic Navy has planted a base on New Wales: so far, just a densely packed cluster of prefabricated barracks and infirmary buildings on the outskirts of one of the mining colonies."

	planet "New Austria"
		description "New Austria is a rugged mountain world, full of snow-capped peaks and valleys so deep and so steep that they rarely see sunlight. The few settlements that have been built here were developed for mining sapphires and rubies; the sapphires found in New Austria range from blue to yellow to black to clear in color, and are used both for industrial abrasives and for jewelry."
		description "The Navy has recently requisitioned one of the abandoned mining towns and begun refurbishing it for a secure military base, with the mining tunnels used as deep underground bunkers."

		description "About a decade ago, a mining corporation from Zug planted a colony on Clink for harvesting some rare earth minerals that are present in this moon's crust due to its unusually high rate of asteroid impacts. The atmosphere here is too thin to breathe without a respirator, and because of the low gravity, the dust raised by the mining operations hangs perpetually in the air."
		description "The miners who work here are a tight-knit group, since most of them were part of the original colonization team. They are not particularly open to outsiders, and the facilities here are so rudimentary that they do not even stock fuel for visiting ships."
