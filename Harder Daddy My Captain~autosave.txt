		description "Ingot is a volcanic moon, totally unsuitable for life but rich in metal. The miners who work here must spend all their time inside pressurized buildings. Because Ingot has almost no atmosphere to slow them down, meteorites are a constant danger to the colonists. The shells of the buildings have multiple layers, designed to be self-sealing in any but the largest of impacts. Most of the mining is done remotely by robotic vehicles, but someone still needs to be present to control them and to make repairs when something goes wrong."

		description "New Wales is home to a few mining outposts which extract and refine rare earth minerals and heavy metals. It is dangerous work: the mines are deep underground and prone to noxious gases and cave-ins, and the refineries work with molten radioactive materials and caustic chemicals. Due to the somewhat dim light of the star Algorel, and the cloudiness of the atmosphere, this is not a good world for farming, and the population remains quite small."
		description "The Republic Navy has planted a base on New Wales: so far, just a densely packed cluster of prefabricated barracks and infirmary buildings on the outskirts of one of the mining colonies."

		description "New Austria is a rugged mountain world, full of snow-capped peaks and valleys so deep and so steep that they rarely see sunlight. The few settlements that have been built here were developed for mining sapphires and rubies; the sapphires found in New Austria range from blue to yellow to black to clear in color, and are used both for industrial abrasives and for jewelry."
		description "The Navy has recently requisitioned one of the abandoned mining towns and begun refurbishing it for a secure military base, with the mining tunnels used as deep underground bunkers."

logbook
	16 11 3013
		"Finally scraped together enough money for a down payment on a starship. The interest on the mortgage is exorbitant."
	16 11 3013
		"Getting some basic instructions on making a living as a merchant from an old captain named James."
	30 11 3013
		"Dropped James off on Hestia after running a few missions with him. Ship still smells like fish."
	10 3 3014
		"Volunteered to help the Southern Mutual Defense Pact keep tabs on pirate activity in their region of space. Pirate attacks seem to be getting worse because the Navy doesn't bother to patrol down here anymore."
	26 2 3016
		"Volunteered to do some recon work for the Free Worlds, as long as there is nothing illegal involved."
	25 4 3016
		"Apparently the Navy is suspicious of anyone who worked with the Southern Mutual Defense Pact; got questioned about it by an officer. It was unclear what his rank or position in the Navy was."
	31 5 3016
		"Was held up at gunpoint by a militia woman in some sort of ill-conceived Free Worlds recruitment test."
	4 6 3016
		"Gave the Free Worlds some photos and information on the Navy base on New Wales. Jean-Jacques, the militia contact, was very grateful for the help."
	4 6 3016
		"Serving as an escort for a Free Worlds supply convoy to Tarazed. It sounds like pirates have been specifically targeting their convoys, recently."
	Factions Alphas
		"The Alphas were designed hundreds of years ago as genetically engineered super-soldiers, with no compassion or empathy. They escaped from their masters, enslaved entire planets, and commanded massive fleets of ships. Eventually they were defeated, and were either killed or went into hiding. They can be recognized by their green, photosynthetic skin."
		"Alphas can live for centuries, and it is likely that many of them have survived, hiding out on anarchist worlds or somewhere beyond human space. Fortunately, they reproduce much more slowly than ordinary humans do."
	Factions Drak
		"The Drak are supposedly the oldest living species in the galaxy. The Quarg say that the Drak act as something like galactic peacekeepers or police, and will intervene if a species invents a weapon so terrible that it could drive that species to extinction."
	Factions "Free Worlds"
		"The Free Worlds is a collection of local governments in the southern galactic arm who have declared independence from the Republic after Parliament refused to address issues they raised about trade tariffs, taxation, and representation. They may be linked to the recent terrorist attacks on the Navy Yard and the galactic stock exchange, although they deny responsibility."
	Factions Pirates
		"In poorer and more remote star systems, where the Navy seldom patrols, pirate attacks on merchant ships are frequent. Pirates are also known to attack large, unguarded convoys of freighters even in more populated areas. Most pirate fleets come from lawless worlds on the outskirts of human space."
	Factions Quarg
		"The Quarg are tall, thin, inscrutable aliens who evolved on a very small planet and can live comfortably on worlds with atmosphere so thin that a human being could not breathe it. They discovered spaceflight millions of years ago. Many of them live on artificially constructed ringworlds, including one in human space. They live at peace with most sentient species and claim to be in communication with an even older species named the Drak."
	Factions Republic
		"Hundreds of years ago, the independent territories in different parts of human space agreed to join together into a single democratic government, with Earth as its capital. The rise of the Republic ushered in a long period of peace and prosperity in human history."
		`Representation in the Republic Parliament is based on population. That means that some individual "Paradise Worlds" have more representatives than entire regions of space like the Dirt Belt that are more sparsely settled.`
	Factions Syndicate
		"The Syndicate is a megacorporation, the largest employer in human space. People who cannot find steady work elsewhere flock to the Syndicate factory worlds, where they are almost guaranteed to find a job. Although the Syndicate is technically part of the Republic, Syndicate worlds are governed directly by the corporation."
		"The Syndicate is a central part of the Republic's economy, but they are also well known for selling shoddy products and for doing damage to the environment on the worlds they control. Their treatment of workers is questionable, and their opposition to organized labor is legendary. Some Syndicate factory towns have even been accused of human rights abuses."
	People "Albert Foster"
		"An archaeologist who is famous for using dubious methods: he has been banned from Quarg space for trying to collect an alloy sample from their ringworld, and is rumored to have also been involved in a scheme involving dinosaur fossils and an illegal genetic resequencer. He is currently based on Vinci, on the edge of the Paradise sector."
