	planet Geminus
		description "Geminus, although not the most hospitable of worlds, is a young enough planet that large stores of iron, titanium, and other metals are easily accessible near the surface. The constant volcanic activity leaves the planet perpetually shrouded in a twilight haze of ash and fog."
		description "	The shattered remnants of the old Navy Yard are still left abandoned and slowly rusting away in the planet's caustic atmosphere, but the Republic has now built a new shipyard to replace the one destroyed in the bombing, and once again Geminus has become a central hub of technology and industry."
		spaceport "Like everything else on Geminus, the spaceport is not terribly pretty, but is functional and efficient. Each of the wide hallways is marked out like a road, with space in the center for electric carts carrying cargo, while pedestrians are relegated to the edges. Video cameras and sensors have been placed at every intersection, and access to the shipbuilding facilities is tightly controlled."
		spaceport "	The hub of the spaceport is a food court with a ring of shops in the center and seating on the outside, where you can look out of plate glass windows at the lava fields and caldera outside. By night, you can see the volcanic glow all around the horizon."

		description "Ingot is a volcanic moon, totally unsuitable for life but rich in metal. The miners who work here must spend all their time inside pressurized buildings. Because Ingot has almost no atmosphere to slow them down, meteorites are a constant danger to the colonists. The shells of the buildings have multiple layers, designed to be self-sealing in any but the largest of impacts. Most of the mining is done remotely by robotic vehicles, but someone still needs to be present to control them and to make repairs when something goes wrong."
		description "Ingot is also now home to a burgeoning Navy base, although since the planet is so unlivable most of the troops are just living in ships in orbit."

		description "New Wales is home to a few mining outposts which extract and refine rare earth minerals and heavy metals. It is dangerous work: the mines are deep underground and prone to noxious gases and cave-ins, and the refineries work with molten radioactive materials and caustic chemicals. Due to the somewhat dim light of the star Algorel, and the cloudiness of the atmosphere, this is not a good world for farming, and the population remains quite small."
		description "The Republic Navy has planted a base on New Wales: so far, just a densely packed cluster of prefabricated barracks and infirmary buildings on the outskirts of one of the mining colonies."

		description "New Austria is a rugged mountain world, full of snow-capped peaks and valleys so deep and so steep that they rarely see sunlight. The few settlements that have been built here were developed for mining sapphires and rubies; the sapphires found in New Austria range from blue to yellow to black to clear in color, and are used both for industrial abrasives and for jewelry."
		description "The Navy has recently requisitioned one of the abandoned mining towns and begun refurbishing it for a secure military base, with the mining tunnels used as deep underground bunkers."

		description "About a decade ago, a mining corporation from Zug planted a colony on Clink for harvesting some rare earth minerals that are present in this moon's crust due to its unusually high rate of asteroid impacts. The atmosphere here is too thin to breathe without a respirator, and because of the low gravity, the dust raised by the mining operations hangs perpetually in the air."
		description "The miners who work here are a tight-knit group, since most of them were part of the original colonization team. They are not particularly open to outsiders, and the facilities here are so rudimentary that they do not even stock fuel for visiting ships."

		description "Farpoint, on the northernmost end of human space, is a rocky desert planet home to a Republic Navy base and not much else. Farming is possible only within greenhouses, and this system is too far from the galactic center to be desirable for trade or industry."
		description "	Lately the Navy base on Farpoint is growing, because it has become the new home of the Navy Oathkeepers, a small branch of the Navy that has sworn to stay uninvolved in the conflict with the Free Worlds."

	planet Thule
		description "Thule is a mountainous world with a population of nearly a billion, settled in the early days of space exploration. When the colony was first established, the Earth government did not yet have the strength to control any system but its own, and when the Republic was formed, Thule did not join, and has repulsed all efforts to force them to do so."
		description "	Until recently, Thule was a well-known den of pirate activity, but the major tribal authorities have now forsworn piracy in the interest of keeping the Free Worlds from further meddling in their affairs. However, it is likely that all manner of illegal activity is still going on in secret here."
	planet "Smuggler's Den"
		description "Smuggler's Den was formerly known as Grendel Station, back when it was an operating refinery. After that, it was taken over by pirates, and became a haven for all manner of smugglers and privateers. Now, at least in theory it is an independent station, no longer allied with the pirates. In practice, you suspect a fair amount of piracy still goes on here."
		description "The repair shops here can make a variety of legal and illegal modifications to your ship, and in the shipyard you can buy refurbished starships... if it does not trouble your conscience to think about the likely fates of their previous owners."
		spaceport "It is a strange but indisputable fact that anarchists smell worse than ordinary human beings. In this day and age, where even the cheapest shuttlecraft at least has a sonic shower, there is no logical explanation for it, except that anarchist tendencies must somehow go hand in hand with a tendency to reject society's norms around hygiene. Here in a space station, with nothing but recycled air to breathe, the effect is overpowering."

The planet was not settled until about a century ago, when a group of investors from Pherkad decided to build a manufacturing center here, rather than trying to find more land on the already overcrowded planet of Solace. Claiming that the industrial emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases would eventually warm the planet and turn it into a tropical paradise, they were able to draw enough settlers to keep the factories going."
		description "	Winter is home to the Free Worlds Conservatory, a new university that is focused on making terraforming technology and expertise available at a reasonable price, as well as on ecological protection and renewal."

		description "	Recently, with the help of the Free Worlds, a new spaceport was completed here. Bloodsea was formerly a pirate world, but the new spaceport has given it an air of respectability, and already a small number of settlers and curious tourists have begun flowing in."
		spaceport "The new spaceport is impressively well designed, with seawalls and landing pads of crisp, newly-set concrete, still unmarked by weather or mildew. It is also several times larger than necessary for the number of people and ships that are here, and aside from a lively market, it feels strangely empty."
		spaceport `	Some things remain unchanged from back in the pirate days. The local slang incorporates threats of extreme violence as a seemingly meaningless verbal tic. "Hey, I'm gonna cut off your fingers one by one until you buy a meat patty!" a vendor calls out cheerfully as you pass. "First one's free, and I'll tie a knot in your spine if you don't like it."`
