	planet "New Asgard"
		description "New Asgard is a relatively small moon, although despite this it is still able to hold onto a thick, breathable atmosphere. Much of the moon is desert, although some areas near the highest mountains do receive enough rain to allow them to become well-forested. The oceans here have enormous tide differences due to the gas giant above, and as a result, most seaside settlements are practically built inside glass domes reinforced with titanium so that they can survive the inrush of water at high tide."
		description "	Despite the relative absence of natural resources, New Asgard is still fairly rich due to the tourism industry- many people come here simply to experience the awe of waking up to see the face of a gas giant staring down at them."
		spaceport "The spaceport is a slick, clean and modern, with hallways paved in dark granite and arching roofs overhead. Most of the terminal is taken up by small stores and off-licenses."
		spaceport "	The entire spaceport seems to be filled with people with cameras, hysterically barging their way through the crowds to find their ride off of this moon."
	planet Jumblar
		description "Now that war has truly begun, the production of warships on this planet appears to have been increased tenfold; every few minutes, a gleaming, new ship flies overhead, arriving at the spaceport to join up with the main fleets."

As a result, while it has not been decimated as completely as Carmine was- especially in the shipbuilding areas- the environment on Alleshafen will continue to be in a dire state thanks to the radiation from the nuclear blasts until well after you are dead."
		spaceport "The spaceport is relatively unscathed; the only marks of battle on it are frequent burns on the walls, clearly from lasers, and the absence of one of the main terminals; you suspect it was destroyed by sustained particle fire."

	planet Arikv
		description "Arikv was settled only fairly recently, according to the locals- the terraforming process is still continuing, which explains the humid conditions, and a decent part of the planet is still uncharted."
		description " However, this planet still boasts a shipyard and a comprehensive outfitter- doubtless due to its strategic position between XSZ and Enclave territory. It appears that the recent XSZ attack against Arikv was, in fact, repulsed successfully; the same cannot be said for the neighbouring systems."

		description "Perihelion is a surprisingly Earth-like world- although, of course, there are very few records remaining in the Tyridium galaxy of what actually constitutes Earth-like. This is a world hotly contested by XSZ- it has very little axial tilt, and almost perfect weather. "
		description "	XSZ-funded surveys have found that there are enormous oil and gas fields beneath the oceans of Perihelion. Despite XSZ's numerous appeals to the Enclave government to allow them to mine the fuels here, the Enclave has refused, every time."
		spaceport "The spaceport is located right on one of the coasts, nearest to the equator. As you stepped off of your ship, a small gaggle of tourists walked past, evidently unaware of the state of relations currently between the Enclave and XSZ, or even the likelihood that this would be one of the first worlds XSZ might move to take in the event of war."

	planet "New Scotland"
		description "New Scotland is a world consisting of scrubland and low mountain ranges, for the most part; it is an old world, where tectonic activity is beginning to die down. As a result of the decrease in tectonic activity, the planet's magnetoshpere is also slowly weakening. This in turn increases the amount of radiation falling on the surface, making the inhabitants much more likely to develop cancerous growths as they age."
		description "	Although this world is currently being occupied by the Kaltheim, you cannot actually see any signs of them in person; the only signs of their activities are the smoking remains of ships crashed into the deserts, and the frequent patrols that fly overhead."
	planet Gahr'wregdl'iahr
		description "This is a world of near-unbearable heat. As day turns to night, oceans emerge in the sunlit deserts, and as night turns to day, billions of cubic metres of liquid evaporate into the grim, foreboding clouds above."
		description "	Gahr'wregdl'iahr is, seemingly, a heavily militarized world. Nearly every facility you see is in some way optimized to contribute to a galactic war effort, with either orbital defense systems in place, heavy-duty planetary shielding, or vast strips of abandoned tarmac landing pads designed for enormous armadas of ships."

	planet Frodo
		landscape land/bwerner3
		description `When the first settlers landed on Frodo, they found the habitable zones of the planet to be remarkably similar to the "Shire" from 'The Lord of the Rings', an infamous book from the 20th century. As a result, they decided to name the planet Frodo, after the book's main character.`
		description "	However, since the Kaltheim attack, much of this planet's previously beautiful landscape has been turned to ash. Fields lie fallow and strewn with dead bodies, while enormous scars mar the hills."
		spaceport "The spaceport lies in ruins, although you were able to find some intact fuel tanks from which to refuel your ships."
	planet Bilbo
		description `As with the planet below, Bilbo was named after a character from 'The Lord of the Rings'. This time, however, this moon was named "Bilbo" due to its odd similarity to the far eastern areas of Middle-Earth, to which the moon's namesake travelled during The Lord of the Rings' prequel. As a result, much of the terrain is tough and mountainous- perfectly suited to the dwarves of fantasy legend.`
		description "	While Bilbo was not hit as hard as its mother planet by the Kaltheim attack, it will still take a long while for the ecosystems to recover."
	planet Memorandum
		description `Memorandum is a very "normal" world. The climate is stable and fairly warm, and days are similar to those on Earth. During the recent alien invasion, most of the population were rounded up and placed in pop-up factories built by the Kaltheim, manufacturing unknown alien components and ships.`
	planet Geminus
		description "Geminus, although not the most hospitable of worlds, is a young enough planet that large stores of iron, titanium, and other metals are easily accessible near the surface. The constant volcanic activity leaves the planet perpetually shrouded in a twilight haze of ash and fog."
		description "	The shattered remnants of the old Navy Yard are still left abandoned and slowly rusting away in the planet's caustic atmosphere, but the Republic has now built a new shipyard to replace the one destroyed in the bombing, and once again Geminus has become a central hub of technology and industry."
		spaceport "Like everything else on Geminus, the spaceport is not terribly pretty, but is functional and efficient. Each of the wide hallways is marked out like a road, with space in the center for electric carts carrying cargo, while pedestrians are relegated to the edges. Video cameras and sensors have been placed at every intersection, and access to the shipbuilding facilities is tightly controlled."
		spaceport "	The hub of the spaceport is a food court with a ring of shops in the center and seating on the outside, where you can look out of plate glass windows at the lava fields and caldera outside. By night, you can see the volcanic glow all around the horizon."

		description "Ingot is a volcanic moon, totally unsuitable for life but rich in metal. The miners who work here must spend all their time inside pressurized buildings. Because Ingot has almost no atmosphere to slow them down, meteorites are a constant danger to the colonists. The shells of the buildings have multiple layers, designed to be self-sealing in any but the largest of impacts. Most of the mining is done remotely by robotic vehicles, but someone still needs to be present to control them and to make repairs when something goes wrong."

It is dangerous work: the mines are deep underground and prone to noxious gases and cave-ins, and the refineries work with molten radioactive materials and caustic chemicals. Due to the somewhat dim light of the star Algorel, and the cloudiness of the atmosphere, this is not a good world for farming, and the population remains quite small."

As a result, this planet is used as a massive, planet-sized fusion reactor in order to both generate large amounts of energy which can be stored and then shipped off-world, and to synthesise some rare elements via controlled fusion."

	planet Crackle
		description "Crackle is one of the main manufacturing and mining worlds in this region of the Tyridium galaxy, thanks to the frequent impacts from objects falling out of the planetary rings above. While these impacts often throw up clouds of dust which may obscure the system's star for days or even weeks at a time, they both bring new material to the planet for mining and dig out large craters, allowing elements usually found deep within the crust to be mined relatively easily."
		description "	Most of the factories are situated well away from where the rings currently orbit; as the ring orbit moves north or south, the industrial centres move with it. They are designed to be able to be disassembled in mere weeks."
	planet "Cavalier Station"
		description "Cavalier Station is a small facility which was once used by XSZ to prospect through the rings of Crackle, hunting for ore-rich bodies to push down onto Crackle."
		description "	Now, however, it has been turned into a ragged military platform, with the last remnants of XSZ holding out here behind the immensely powerful shields."
		spaceport "The docking areas have been turned into wastelands, entirely stripped of useful parts, the doors into the rest of the station barred with huge chunks of debris."

		description `The governing authorites on Cynic are notoriously stubborn and rebellious, having landed it the title of "Largest Thorn in XSZ's Backside" almost every year before it was liberated by the Enclave.`
		description "	Since the liberation, however, an alarmingly lower amount of money has been invested in the development of new reactors- a move by the Enclave which will doubtlessly slow down technological development in this galaxy."

	planet Magna
		description "Magna is a desolate planet, having been continually strip mined by XSZ for the past two centuries. However, there are a reasonable number of settlements here. The reason why? XSZ's largest shipyards were once located here, meaning thousands of people migrated here each year to fill the massive number of jobs required to work in the shipyards, as well as the mines."
		description "	While you hear Storm Crow Industries has plans to salvage some of XSZ's old designs and convert the shipyards here into a new complex for manufacturing their own ships, nothing has happened as of yet. As a result, many families are out of work, with grumblings of discontent common among the populace."
		spaceport "The spaceport is an enormous complex, taking advantage of the massive space afforded by being in an area that has already been exhausted of its raw materials."
		spaceport "	A good third of the spaceport is filled by the now derelict and abandoned recruiting offices for various divisions of XSZ- XSZ Shipyards, XSZ Steel, XSZ Systems- and more."

	planet Mirrodin
		description "Mirrodin is an advanced space station designed by the XSZ Corporation. Encompassing much of the Skryydr system, Mirrodin is somewhat like a Quarg ringworld, albeit that it is constructed with proportions more suited to your human psyche. Mirrodin, like an onion, consists of layers; the spaceports are situated on the outer edge of the ring, followed by the outfitters and shipyards, then the commercial band, and then the residential sector, facing the star in the centre of the system."
		description "	The interior corridors are heavily scarred from the fighting between the occupying pirate forces and the Enclave's military in the weeks after the fall of XSZ. Luckily, Mirrodin's advanced hull prevented any breaches- relatively few civilians were killed during the fighting."

		landscape land/fields13-sfiera
		description "This planet was once the home of the Enclave's largest ship manufacturing centres, much like Geminus in the Republic. While it is a relatively old world, the crust is composed mostly of very heavy metals and rocks, and so handily, the lighter metals which are useful for shipbuilding are found very near to the surface."
		description "Like Carmine, however, Alleshafen bore the brunt of a large number of nuclear attacks. As a result, while it has not been decimated as completely as Carmine was- especially in the shipbuilding areas- the environment on Alleshafen will continue to be in a dire state thanks to the radiation from the nuclear blasts until well after you are dead."
		spaceport "	The nuclear attacks on Alleshafen, and the successive pirate occupation have led to a sudden surge of emigration to other planets. The year-long nuclear winters, widespread destruction of infrastructure, and irradiated environment have suddenly made Alleshafen an undesirable place to live. Consequently, the remains of the spaceport are bursting with refugees, looking for a way to get off-world."

		"Finally scraped together enough money for a down payment on a starship. The interest on the mortgage is exorbitant."
	Factions Alphas
		"The Alphas were designed hundreds of years ago as genetically engineered super-soldiers, with no compassion or empathy. They escaped from their masters, enslaved entire planets, and commanded massive fleets of ships. Eventually they were defeated, and were either killed or went into hiding. They can be recognized by their green, photosynthetic skin."
		"Alphas can live for centuries, and it is likely that many of them have survived, hiding out on anarchist worlds or somewhere beyond human space. Fortunately, they reproduce much more slowly than ordinary humans do."
	Factions "Free Worlds"
		"The Free Worlds is a collection of local governments in the southern galactic arm who have declared independence from the Republic after Parliament refused to address issues they raised about trade tariffs, taxation, and representation. They may be linked to the recent terrorist attacks on the Navy Yard and the galactic stock exchange, although they deny responsibility."
	Factions Pirates
		"In poorer and more remote star systems, where the Navy seldom patrols, pirate attacks on merchant ships are frequent. Pirates are also known to attack large, unguarded convoys of freighters even in more populated areas. Most pirate fleets come from lawless worlds on the outskirts of human space."
	Factions Republic
		"Hundreds of years ago, the independent territories in different parts of human space agreed to join together into a single democratic government, with Earth as its capital. The rise of the Republic ushered in a long period of peace and prosperity in human history."
		`Representation in the Republic Parliament is based on population. That means that some individual "Paradise Worlds" have more representatives than entire regions of space like the Dirt Belt that are more sparsely settled.`
	Factions Syndicate
		"The Syndicate is a megacorporation, the largest employer in human space. People who cannot find steady work elsewhere flock to the Syndicate factory worlds, where they are almost guaranteed to find a job. Although the Syndicate is technically part of the Republic, Syndicate worlds are governed directly by the corporation."
		"The Syndicate is a central part of the Republic's economy, but they are also well known for selling shoddy products and for doing damage to the environment on the worlds they control. Their treatment of workers is questionable, and their opposition to organized labor is legendary. Some Syndicate factory towns have even been accused of human rights abuses."
