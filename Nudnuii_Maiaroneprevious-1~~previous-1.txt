		description "Perihelion is a surprisingly Earth-like world- although, of course, there are very few records remaining in the Tyridium galaxy of what actually constitutes Earth-like. This is a world hotly contested by XSZ- it has very little axial tilt, and almost perfect weather. "
		description "	XSZ-funded surveys have found that there are enormous oil and gas fields beneath the oceans of Perihelion. Despite XSZ's numerous appeals to the Enclave government to allow them to mine the fuels here, the Enclave has refused, every time."

	planet "New Scotland"
		description "New Scotland is a world consisting of scrubland and low mountain ranges, for the most part; it is an old world, where tectonic activity is beginning to die down. As a result of the decrease in tectonic activity, the planet's magnetoshpere is also slowly weakening. This in turn increases the amount of radiation falling on the surface, making the inhabitants much more likely to develop cancerous growths as they age."
		description "	Although this world is currently being occupied by the Kaltheim, you cannot actually see any signs of them in person; the only signs of their activities are the smoking remains of ships crashed into the deserts, and the frequent patrols that fly overhead."
	planet Gahr'wregdl'iahr
		description "This is a world of near-unbearable heat. As day turns to night, oceans emerge in the sunlit deserts, and as night turns to day, billions of cubic metres of liquid evaporate into the grim, foreboding clouds above."
		description "	Gahr'wregdl'iahr is, seemingly, a heavily militarized world. Nearly every facility you see is in some way optimized to contribute to a galactic war effort, with either orbital defense systems in place, heavy-duty planetary shielding, or vast strips of abandoned tarmac landing pads designed for enormous armadas of ships."

		description "I think when they named this planet, the idea was to have it be home to some of the greatest educational and scientific institutes in the whole galaxy."
		description "	Yeah, that never happened. Instead, when some amazing narcotic plants were discovered here, the central galactic government didn't find out about them until it was social norm on Seminar to use substances derived from these plants every. Single. Day."
		description "It appears that the Kaltheim didn't really know what to do with this world when they captured it; they have left it entirely untouched, apart from the scars of some superficial orbital bombardment."

		description "Ingot is a volcanic moon, totally unsuitable for life but rich in metal. The miners who work here must spend all their time inside pressurized buildings. Because Ingot has almost no atmosphere to slow them down, meteorites are a constant danger to the colonists. The shells of the buildings have multiple layers, designed to be self-sealing in any but the largest of impacts. Most of the mining is done remotely by robotic vehicles, but someone still needs to be present to control them and to make repairs when something goes wrong."

		description "New Wales is home to a few mining outposts which extract and refine rare earth minerals and heavy metals. It is dangerous work: the mines are deep underground and prone to noxious gases and cave-ins, and the refineries work with molten radioactive materials and caustic chemicals. Due to the somewhat dim light of the star Algorel, and the cloudiness of the atmosphere, this is not a good world for farming, and the population remains quite small."
		description "The Republic Navy has planted a base on New Wales: so far, just a densely packed cluster of prefabricated barracks and infirmary buildings on the outskirts of one of the mining colonies."

		description "About a decade ago, a mining corporation from Zug planted a colony on Clink for harvesting some rare earth minerals that are present in this moon's crust due to its unusually high rate of asteroid impacts. The atmosphere here is too thin to breathe without a respirator, and because of the low gravity, the dust raised by the mining operations hangs perpetually in the air."
		description "The miners who work here are a tight-knit group, since most of them were part of the original colonization team. They are not particularly open to outsiders, and the facilities here are so rudimentary that they do not even stock fuel for visiting ships."

		description "Thule is a mountainous world with a population of nearly a billion, settled in the early days of space exploration. When the colony was first established, the Earth government did not yet have the strength to control any system but its own, and when the Republic was formed, Thule did not join, and has repulsed all efforts to force them to do so."
		description "	Until recently, Thule was a well-known den of pirate activity, but the major tribal authorities have now forsworn piracy in the interest of keeping the Free Worlds from further meddling in their affairs. However, it is likely that all manner of illegal activity is still going on in secret here."

After that, it was taken over by pirates, and became a haven for all manner of smugglers and privateers. Now, at least in theory it is an independent station, no longer allied with the pirates. In practice, you suspect a fair amount of piracy still goes on here."
		description "The repair shops here can make a variety of legal and illegal modifications to your ship, and in the shipyard you can buy refurbished starships... if it does not trouble your conscience to think about the likely fates of their previous owners."
		spaceport "It is a strange but indisputable fact that anarchists smell worse than ordinary human beings. In this day and age, where even the cheapest shuttlecraft at least has a sonic shower, there is no logical explanation for it, except that anarchist tendencies must somehow go hand in hand with a tendency to reject society's norms around hygiene. Here in a space station, with nothing but recycled air to breathe, the effect is overpowering."

The planet was not settled until about a century ago, when a group of investors from Pherkad decided to build a manufacturing center here, rather than trying to find more land on the already overcrowded planet of Solace. Claiming that the industrial emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases would eventually warm the planet and turn it into a tropical paradise, they were able to draw enough settlers to keep the factories going."
		description "	Winter is home to the Free Worlds Conservatory, a new university that is focused on making terraforming technology and expertise available at a reasonable price, as well as on ecological protection and renewal."

		description "	Recently, with the help of the Free Worlds, a new spaceport was completed here. Bloodsea was formerly a pirate world, but the new spaceport has given it an air of respectability, and already a small number of settlers and curious tourists have begun flowing in."
		spaceport "The new spaceport is impressively well designed, with seawalls and landing pads of crisp, newly-set concrete, still unmarked by weather or mildew. It is also several times larger than necessary for the number of people and ships that are here, and aside from a lively market, it feels strangely empty."
		spaceport `	Some things remain unchanged from back in the pirate days. The local slang incorporates threats of extreme violence as a seemingly meaningless verbal tic. "Hey, I'm gonna cut off your fingers one by one until you buy a meat patty!" a vendor calls out cheerfully as you pass. "First one's free, and I'll tie a knot in your spine if you don't like it."`

		description "Geminus, although not the most hospitable of worlds, is a young enough planet that large stores of iron, titanium, and other metals are easily accessible near the surface. The constant volcanic activity leaves the planet perpetually shrouded in a twilight haze of ash and fog."
		description "	The shattered remnants of the old Navy Yard are still left abandoned and slowly rusting away in the planet's caustic atmosphere, but the Republic has now built a new shipyard to replace the one destroyed in the bombing, and once again Geminus has become a central hub of technology and industry."
		spaceport "Like everything else on Geminus, the spaceport is not terribly pretty, but is functional and efficient. Each of the wide hallways is marked out like a road, with space in the center for electric carts carrying cargo, while pedestrians are relegated to the edges. Video cameras and sensors have been placed at every intersection, and access to the shipbuilding facilities is tightly controlled."
		spaceport "	The hub of the spaceport is a food court with a ring of shops in the center and seating on the outside, where you can look out of plate glass windows at the lava fields and caldera outside. By night, you can see the volcanic glow all around the horizon."

		description "Varu K'est is a spare, ancient planet of arid plateaus and deep, meandering canyons, with too little rainfall to support any but the hardiest of shrubs. Before the Unfettered invaded, the only Wanderer settlements remaining here were the military bases they had set up to defend their frontier. Now, it is home to an ever-growing number of Unfettered settlements, including many civilians who have come here just for the chance to live on a world that is not overcrowded and polluted."
		spaceport "The Unfettered are using the few jump drives they have to ferry more and more of their people into Wanderer space. When each wave of ships arrives here in the spaceport, technicians carefully remove the jump drives from all but a few of them. A few well guarded jump-capable ships then carry those spare jump drives back to Unfettered space, where they are used to bring more ships and people."

The Wanderers did not have time to demolish any of their equipment or to carry it off-world before the planet was lost. As a result, they have given the Unfettered a significant technological advantage here."
		spaceport "The Unfettered seem to be quite at home in the tree house dwellings that the Wanderers left behind, and the Unfettered youth living here scramble up trunks and leap from tree to tree with reckless abandon, exulting in this new world they have captured and trying to outdo each other with their daredevil escapades."

		attributes unfettered farming
		description "The Wanderers worked for years to make this desert world bloom: planting hardy shrubs and cacti that eventually transform the sand into a soil that can hold moisture. In some regions, especially closer to the poles, the deserts have given way to dense forests, but near the equator there are still large stretches of dry and barren sand, broken by the occasional belt of green where a narrow river winds between the dunes."
		description "	Now that the Unfettered have taken over control of the planet, it may be only a matter of time before the deserts dominate it once again."
		spaceport "The spaceport is in a forest village near the planet's north pole. The landing pads are massive stone monoliths laid on the ground in a nearby clearing. But aside from a few large warehouses at ground level, the village itself is entirely made of tree-houses. Although they are very different from Hai architecture, the Unfettered seem to be quite at home living in the tree-houses, and have not built many of their own structures yet."

	planet "Var' Kar'i'i"
		attributes unfettered urban farming
		description "Of all the worlds that the Unfettered have captured, this is surely the one that the Wanderers will miss the most: a heavily forested planet that was once home to countless small villages and even a few cities. The Unfettered are clearly doing their best to tend the farms here, but they operate on a permaculture system that relies heavily on maintaining a delicate ecological balance, rather than on machines and pesticides."
		spaceport "A large number of Unfettered settlers have already arrived here and begun setting up a spaceport village, complete with markets, taverns, and military barracks. To the Unfettered, who have lived their whole lives on worlds where the local ecology is in shambles, this planet must seem like a paradise."

		attributes unfettered fishing
		description "The surface of this world is almost entirely ocean. The Wanderer settlements were built on massive floating algae mats, some of them the size of a small city. Engines are attached to some of these floating villages, allowing them to be slowly propelled from one part of the planet's surface to another, and the only native industries are fishing and seaweed farming."
		spaceport "The raft of algae that supports the spaceport is probably at least a dozen meters thick, but flexible enough that it bends as the ocean swells pass underneath, causing individual buildings to rise up or tilt slightly relative to their neighbors. Now that this world has been captured by the Unfettered, nearly all the buildings are empty; it appears that the Hai are not too fond of the idea of inhabiting a water world, so they are using it mostly as a military base."

The ruins of several Korath cities and the geometric grids of cleared land surrounding them show that this was once a farming world, but now few plants are able to survive and kilometer-high glaciers have begun creeping down from the poles."

The layout of the streets is completely chaotic, and they have planted rows of trees and bushes everywhere: some inside greenhouses, and some hardier species out in the open air.

The Wanderers, working together with the Kor Efreti, have founded a settlement here and begun working to accelerate the process of rejuvenating the wastelands."

Since most of them do not speak each other's language, the two groups do not mingle much, and communicate mostly via gestures and drawings. It's not much, but it's at least a start for the two species to begin learning from each other."

It is, however, the best source of heavy metals in the galactic south. Aside from the managers of the mining companies, nearly all the people here are migrant workers from elsewhere in the Dirt Belt, who have come to spend a season working for the relatively high wages that uranium mining offers, either to send money off-world or to save it up in order to build a better life for themselves."

		description "Zug is a pleasant world of rolling hills, fertile fields, and a few small oceans. Hundreds of millions of people live here, with more immigrants arriving every day, almost faster than the construction industry can keep up with them. In addition to the larger cities, many people live in smaller farming villages, making this one of the few worlds in the region that is truly self-sufficient both in industry and in agriculture."
		description "	The largest industry on Zug is Southbound Shipyards. However, in the wake of some extraordinary archaeological discoveries of a lost civilization, Zug has suddenly also become a popular destination for tourists."

Much of the moon is desert, although some areas near the highest mountains do receive enough rain to allow them to become well-forested. The oceans here have enormous tide differences due to the gas giant above, and as a result, most seaside settlements are practically built inside glass domes reinforced with titanium so that they can survive the inrush of water at high tide."
		description "	Despite the relative absence of natural resources, New Asgard is still fairly rich due to the tourism industry- many people come here simply to experience the awe of waking up to see the face of a gas giant staring down at them."
		spaceport "The spaceport is a slick, clean and modern, with hallways paved in dark granite and arching roofs overhead. Most of the terminal is taken up by small stores and off-licenses."

		"The Navy has been driven out of the Rastaban system. That will allow the people on Dancer, New Portland, and New India to join the Free Worlds."
	21 7 3016
		"Was given the choice of what to do with the Navy prisoners from the battle for Rastaban, and decided to parole and release them rather than imprisoning them. Hopefully that will earn some goodwill from the Navy in the future."
	24 7 3016
		"Once again there is no immediate work to be done for the Free Worlds. This would be a good time to earn some money for an upgraded ship, if possible."
	11 3 3017
		"Three more planets have decided to defect to the Free Worlds: Clark, New Tibet, and New Holland."
	17 4 3017
		"The shipyard on Zug is still trying to ramp up Dreadnought production. So far only a few ships have been built, but Freya will be helping to speed up the process."
	24 4 3017
		"Agreed to become a member of the Free Worlds council, taking Tomek's spot."
	8 5 3017
		"The Republic world of Poisonwood in the south has apparently been taken over by Alpha warlords. It is such a dire threat that despite the war, the Navy Oathkeepers have agreed to fight alongside the Free Worlds to liberate the planet."
	14 5 3017
		"With the help of the Oathkeepers, liberated Poisonwood from the Alpha invaders."
	26 5 3017
		"The local leaders on the lawless world of Bloodsea have said that they will join the Free Worlds, and stop supporting piracy, in exchange for the equipment to build a more modern spaceport. However, they may just be trying to steal the construction materials; it might be simpler to just attack and conquer them."
	10 6 3017
		"Brought the construction supplies that the people of Bloodsea requested, and they have agreed to join the Free Worlds."
	10 6 3017
		"Freya has announced that Dreadnoughts are now for sale on Zug. Finally the Free Worlds have a warship that can stand up to Navy capital ships."
	16 7 3017
		"The people of Albatross, another anarchist world, have agreed to join the Free Worlds in gratitude for having been liberated from Ryk Bartlett, a warlord who was extorting them for protection money."
	20 7 3017
		"Another two planets, Rand and Oblivion, have expressed an interest in joining the Free Worlds. They are rather far from the rest of Free Worlds territory, however, so JJ is worried that it would create an indefensible tactical position."
	25 7 3017
		"The Navy has invaded Rastaban and Delta Sagittarii, effectively slicing through Free Worlds territory and splitting up the Free Worlds fleet."
	31 7 3017
		"As a member of the Council, must make the deciding vote on a difficult decision. A defector from the Syndicate is claiming to have proof that the Syndicate was behind the bombings of Martini and Gemini. If that is true, the Republic may agree to make peace with the Free Worlds. But, refusing to return the defector to the Syndicate would certainly earn their enmity."
	10 8 3017
		"Decided to rescue the Syndicate defector rather than turning him over to the Syndicate. A Questioner who works with Navy Intelligence has confirmed that he is telling the truth, and a ceasefire has been declared. Also, the Navy has agreed to release Katya now that there is evidence proving her innocence."
	6 9 3017
		"Collected atmospheric samples from Mutiny, a planet deep in Syndicate space, and verified that a nuclear test has been performed here using isotopes that match those from the attacks on Geminus and Martini. Also found carefully hidden signs of an underground test site."
	14 9 3017
		"Parliament still refuses to believe that the Syndicate could have been behind the attacks; the Syndicate has far too much power and influence in the government of the Republic. But, the people of the Deep might be more open to the defector's story."
	23 9 3017
		`The governor of Valhalla, in the Deep, has proposed a "police action" to arrest one or more of the Syndicate leaders and bring them to justice. It will be a secret joint operation between the Free Worlds, the Deep, and the Oathkeepers.`
	14 10 3017
		"Visited a village on a lawless world in northern Syndicate space, and purchased information on the whereabouts of several of the Syndicate executives who were implicated in the terrorist attacks."
	25 11 3017
		"Dropped off a team of Republic diplomats on Bourne. It seems like for now, the ceasefire is holding, and public opinion is slowly turning to favor the Free Worlds rather than the Syndicate. But the Syndicate leaders must still be brought to justice. The Council will be in touch when they are ready to help launch an attack on the Syndicate."
	23 12 3017
		"The Free Worlds will soon have a new reactor core of their own design available for sale. It probably will not be as advanced as Navy technology, however."
	28 1 3018
		"Preparing to invade Syndicate space with a joint strike force made up of Free Worlds, Deep security, and Oathkeeper ships. The plan is to capture one of the Syndicate executives and bring him to trial."
	18 2 3018
		`Succeeded in capturing a Syndicate executive named Alexander Soylent, but the Syndicate has responded by sending a massive fleet to Sol, supposedly to "protect" Earth but more likely to put pressure on Parliament and the people of Earth to side with the Syndicate.`
	1 3 3018
		"All communications with Rand, which recently joined the Free Worlds but is close to Syndicate territory, have been cut off. It is possible that this is the beginning of a Syndicate invasion."
	9 3 3018
		"No one on Arabia knows what has caused hyperspace links in this region of space to suddenly disappear. There are stories of graviton surges and an alien ship, but they may all just be rumors."
	15 3 3018
		"No one on Tundra, which is one of Rand's neighbors, has any idea how the hyperspace link was cut off. They wonder if this might have something to do with a star system near Rand that was inaccessible by hyperdrive."
	19 3 3018
		"The Syndicate may be cutting off the hyperspace links that join their territory to the rest of human space, in order to escape being punished for their crimes. People are worried that they will try to take over even more territory, including Earth itself."
	27 3 3018
		"Agreed to travel to Syndicate space through the one remaining hyperspace path that is still open, through the uninhabited star systems to the north."
	16 4 3018
		"The Syndicate CEO claims that the disappearing hyperspace links are not their doing, and that in fact they are under attack by aliens. In fact, they say that the Syndicate has had contact with two different alien species in this region - raiders and scavengers known as the Korath coming from the galactic core, and an enigmatic and irrational species named the Pug who occupy the system adjacent to the ones that recently got cut off from human space."
		"By plundering the Korath raiders, the Syndicate has acquired some jump drives, which allow a ship to travel between systems that are not connected by hyperspace links. They are willing to part with one of these jump drives in order to prove the truth of their story to the rest of humanity."
	26 4 3018
		"Located the Pug homeworld, and met with some of them. They say that they have annexed the neighboring systems into the Pug Protectorate in order to stop the human civil war. However, their idea of bringing peace seems to involve conquering human space and replacing the Republic with their own government."
	6 5 3018
		"The governor of Valhalla, in the Deep, says that the Pug secretly assisted the people of the Deep to fight against the Alphas centuries ago, during the Alpha Wars. He thinks that the Pug have humanity's best interests at heart, but agrees that they can't be allowed to overthrow the Republic."
	28 5 3018
		"Learned from the Quarg that they have long been aware of the presence of the Pug in the Deneb system. Apparently the Pug are from another galaxy and possess such advanced technology that even the Quarg do not dare to interfere with them."
		"However, the Pug are known to treat warfare like a game, intentionally using weaker technology when fighting less advanced species in order to give them a fair chance at winning the battle. So, fighting them will not be a lost cause, but the Quarg are unwilling to provide any assistance."
	28 6 3018
		"The Free Worlds and Republic Navy are sending a joint fleet into Syndicate space, where they will be fitted with jump drives to make an assault on Pug territory. The Syndicate only has six jump drives available, so this fleet will have to survive without reinforcements until a way is found to reopen the connection to the rest of human space."
	14 7 3018
		"Succeeded in driving the Pug out of the Delta Capricorni system for long enough to land on Maker and explore the technology that the Pug left behind. Freya thinks that she has discovered the device that is used for creating or destroying hyperspace links, but it will take time for her to figure out how to operate it."
	19 7 3018
		"Freya succeeded in reopening the hyperspace link to one of the Syndicate systems. If the same can be done for the link to Sol, the entire Navy will be able to join the battle against the Pug."
	23 7 3018
		"Succeeded in rendezvousing with the Navy in the Sol system and reopening a link to the Pug territory. But now Shiver is under attack by a massive Pug fleet."
	25 7 3018
		"Preparing for the final assault on the Pug homeworld. There seems to be no other option but to force them to surrender, but with the help of the Navy that no longer seems like an impossible task."

		`The Pug have fled, apparently traveling through an artificial wormhole back to whatever galaxy they came from. And, it turns out that many of their cities on "Pugglemug" were only for show: buildings with no inhabitants, and with holograms creating the appearance of a heavily populated world. They left no advanced technology behind, and no sign of what their true intentions were, but it turns out that the fake cities here were designed for human habitation. They must have been planning this departure for a very long time.`
		`Now that the Pug are gone, the Navy will be able to use the "graviton reflectors" to repair the broken hyperspace links and to reconnect all of human space.`
	1 8 3018
		"With the Pug defeated, it is finally time to deal with the Syndicate extremists and the Alphas that they allied with. The extremists are armed with nuclear missiles, but the Syndicate CEO has agreed to provide a cloaking device that will make it possible to dodge the missiles."
	9 8 3018
		"Succeeded in drawing the fire of the Syndicate extremists for long enough for a Navy fleet to safely arrive in-system and assist in destroying them. This cloaking device will come in very handy in the future."
	15 8 3018
		"Received an official commendation from Parliament and a promise that the war with the Free Worlds is officially over. Humanity is at peace once more, but new challenges may await in the star systems out beyond human space that are accessible only by jump drive."
	1 9 3018
		"Discovered a birdlike alien species to the north of human space. They appear to speak the Hai language in addition to their own, so with the help of a Hai interpreter it might be possible to communicate with them."
	21 9 3018
		`Was able to communicate with the birdlike "Wanderers" with the help of a Hai ambassador. It turns out that they have been under attack by the Unfettered Hai for some time, and have learned the Hai language by taking captives.`
	3 11 3018
		"Received a device, created by a Hai scientist, which can translate between human language and the Hai language. Since the Wanderers speak the Hai language, that should make it possible to communicate with them directly."
	14 11 3018
		"Spoke with a Wanderer ambassador named Iktat Rek, using the translation device. Received permission to purchase some of their technology, but not their ships."
	4 12 3018
		"Helped to defend a Wanderer world against a raid by Unfettered Hai ships."
	7 12 3018
		"There is a Pug world close to Wanderer space. Given their ability to control wormholes, it is likely that they are the ones who have been controlling where the Wanderers go and when. But, the Wanderers are not particularly disturbed by this information."
	7 12 3018
		`Volunteered to help bring a shipment of food to the Unfettered, as "tribute" from the Wanderers, in the hope that it will placate the Unfettered into making peace.`
	23 12 3018
		"Managed to broker a temporary ceasefire between the Unfettered Hai and the Wanderers. Was granted access to purchase the non-military Wanderer ships, as a reward."
	5 2 3019
		"Agreed to try to sell a jump drive to the Unfettered Hai, as a way to get more information from them about who else is providing them with jump drives and enabling their attacks on the Wanderers."
	11 2 3019
		`Learned from the Unfettered Hai that they have been purchasing jump drives from the Alphas (who they refer to as "unfettered humans").`
	27 2 3019
		"Planted some surveillance devices, designed by the Wanderers, in Unfettered Hai space. A month from now, they will be done collecting data on ship movements in the area, and may provide a hint of where the Alphas who are selling jump drives to the Unfettered are coming from."
	21 4 3019
		"Met a human named Elias Hanover who is friends with the Quarg and who has been given permission to use Quarg technology to track the Alpha ship that is selling jump drives to the Unfettered."
	16 6 3019
		"Defeated a Navy Carrier, presumably being operated by the Alphas, that was equipped with Korath fighters and drones. Presumably there is an Alpha base hidden somewhere on the earth-like planet that the carrier was guarding."
	24 11 3019
		"Admiral Danforth agreed to bring his cruiser to the planet in Korath space where the Alphas seem to be hiding, with enough troops and equipment to launch an assault on the base."
	12 12 3019
		"The Alphas have fled from the base on Avalon. The Oathkeepers destroyed what is left of the base, which will hopefully set the Alphas back quite a bit."
	27 12 3019
		"Was taken captive, along with Elias Hanover, by some nameless Republic officers who thought Elias was an Alpha. They discovered that he is not one, although he appears to have some of the same genetically engineered advantages that the Alphas have."
	20 1 3020
		"Reported to the Wanderers that the Alphas who had been selling jump drives to the Unfettered have been weakened and driven into hiding. The Wanderers are ramping up production of military ships to try to face the continuing Unfettered onslaught."
	7 6 3020
		"The Unfettered have established a beachhead on one of the Wanderer worlds and are now apparently using what few jump drives they possess to shuttle more and more warships into Wanderer space. War has begun in earnest."
	17 6 3020
		"Helped to evacuate some Wanderers from one of their worlds that is closest to Unfettered space."
	21 6 3020
		"Helped to defend a Wanderer planet from an Unfettered attack. But, the Wanderers now plan to abandon that planet. The Wanderers seem very hesitant to actually stand their ground and fight back."
	2 7 3020
		"Visited the Pug planet adjacent to Wanderer space to see if they are willing to step in and help the Wanderers now that the Unfettered Hai pose such a threat and have captured several Wanderer worlds. But for whatever reason, the Pug insist on the Wanderers fighting for themselves."
	16 7 3020
		"Traveled to the Hai homeworld with ambassador Sayari to see if she can convince the Hai to take action to restrain the Unfettered from attacking the Wanderers. The most that the Hai were willing to do was to mass a large war fleet near Unfettered space so that the Unfettered have to divert warships there to defend their home worlds."
	20 7 3020
		"The Unfettered are unwilling to agree to even a temporary ceasefire with the Wanderers. They seem to think that they will win this war easily."
	27 7 3020
		`Returned to Wanderer space, and discovered that Iktat Rek has begun the "Molt." He is afraid that because the Eye has not yet opened, the Molt will not be viable and it will end up killing him.`
	30 7 3020
		"Received permission to purchase warships from the Wanderers, including a new one called the Tempest."
	14 8 3020
		"Helped to defend a Wanderer world from yet another Unfettered attack. Meanwhile, the Wanderers are trying to move as many civilians as possible back to their home world, where they will be safe. But, their strategy seems to be based on the hope that sometime soon a wormhole will open and allow the Wanderer people to flee to a new territory and leave their old planets behind for the Unfettered to claim."
	16 8 3020
		"Helped to rescue some Wanderers who were stranded and had to go into hiding in the forest when their planet was taken over by the Unfettered."
	24 8 3020
		"Brought Iktat Rek to a Wanderer hospital facility. His illness, or molt, is progressing, and he has grown much weaker. But his mind is still as sharp as ever, and in fact he has somehow managed to pick up human language just by listening to the words of the translation machine."
	17 9 3020
		"Iktat Rek has been placed in protective quarantine in a germ-free room, where he will receive drugs that will suppress his immune system and allow the genetic change that is taking place in his body to be completed. Even if he survives the process, it may change him beyond recognition."
	23 9 3020
		`The Wanderers have begun producing even larger warships, and have succeeded in driving off yet another Unfettered assault. Afterwards the Pug, whom the Wanderers refer to as the "Keepers," finally sent assistance... in the form of two ships, which they claim are powerful enough to keep the entire Unfettered fleet at bay.`
	14 2 3021
		`The "Eye" wormhole has opened in Wanderer space, but the territory on the other side of the wormhole is Korath space, ravaged by their civil war and still infested with autonomous war machines. Nonetheless, the Wanderers are excited to once again begin their work of healing and repairing damaged worlds.`
	26 8 3021
		`The "Kor Sestor" drones turn out to all be controlled remotely, presumably by either an artificial intelligence or by Korath leaders in hiding on one of their worlds. If the control center could be found, it would be possible to gain control of the entire Kor Sestor fleet.`
	3 9 3021
		`Discovered that the "Kor Mereti" drone ships are controlled by some sort of collective and decentralized artificial intelligence, with no obvious weaknesses.`
	4 9 3021
		`Iktat Rek has survived the Molt, but in a completely new form. Rek is now female, and is only the size of a Wanderer child, and has chosen the name "Ektasi Rek" for herself, meaning something like "communicator" or "bridge-builder."`
	8 9 3021
		"Rek's metamorphosis seems to have given her enhanced ability to understand other languages. She will be staying with the friendly Korath for a while in order to learn how to communicate with them."
	10 9 3021
		"The Quarg (or possibly, a faction within the Quarg, or even just a group of Quarg acting on their own) have agreed to send three of their warships to help defend the Wanderer settlement in Korath space. (Or maybe they are sending the ships because they view the Wanderers as invaders and want to keep an eye on them. It is not easy to determine their true intentions.)"
	18 9 3021
		"Visited the Pug to see if they are willing to help the Wanderers fight the Korath automata. But the Pug and the Quarg do not get along with each other, and therefore the Pug are not willing to enter Korath space."
	10 10 3021
		"The Wanderers think that it might be possible to infect the Kor Mereti communications network with something akin to a computer virus, to either take control of the drones or disable them entirely."
	17 10 3021
		"Helped to defend one of the friendly Korath worlds from an attack by Kor Mereti drones. There are Korath scientists on that world who have been working for decades to find a way to hack into the Kor Mereti network, but they do not think it is possible."
	26 10 3021
		"Tested a device that the Wanderers thought would be able to force itself into the Kor Mereti network and take control of it. The experiment completely failed, however."
	31 10 3021
		"The Wanderers have a new plan: to try to either subvert or possibly even befriend the Kor Mereti network by connecting it to a powerful Wanderer artificial intelligence."
	15 12 3021
		"The Wanderers want to install one of their artificial Minds on a space station controlled by the Kor Mereti. Their theory is that if the Mind is physically located within a Kor Mereti station, the drones will be much more likely to accept it as part of their own network instead of reacting to it as an outside intruder."
	24 12 3021
		"The Wanderer ploy has succeeded, but with an unexpected result. The Kor Mereti drones have so thoroughly absorbed the Wanderer Mind into their own consciousness that the drones now believe that they themselves are Wanderers."
	27 12 3021
		"The Wanderers have come to believe that prior to the introduction of their Mind, the Kor Mereti network was not actually a self-aware entity, but that it has now become a sentient being in its own right. And, it is apparently a sentient being with a deep interest in gardening."
	11 1 3022
		"Brought a group of Wanderer mentors and teachers to one of the Kor Mereti worlds, where they will seek to build a relationship with the drones and to help them learn to care for living things and to join in the Wanderer work of healing devastated planets."
	11 3 3022
		"Leading some of the friendly Korath on a tour through Wanderer space, to show them how successful the Wanderers have been at repairing and caring for worlds that have been damaged by war."
	12 4 3022
		"Agreed to travel through Kor Sestor space, scanning the planets to try to look for the facility that is remotely controlling the Kor Sestor drones."
	12 5 3022
		"Someone else seems to have located the Kor Sestor command center before the Wanderers did, and has taken control of the Kor Sestor fleet. Most of the Kor Sestor drones flew through the Eye into the old Wanderer territory, where the Wanderers will probably not be prepared to fight them."
	4 7 3022
		"The Kor Sestor fleet has somehow made its way into northern human space, perhaps using a small number of jump drives to ferry ships back and forth the same way that the Unfettered invaders did. Admiral Danforth says that the system where the Korath ships have gathered is home to a secret Alpha base, so he is concerned that the Kor Sestor drones are under Alpha control."
	13 7 3022
		"Recruited some Quarg warships to help defend human space from the Kor Sestor drones, which are now presumably under Alpha control. Danforth believes that he has located the Alpha base from which the drones are being controlled; if the base is destroyed the drones ought to become aimless and be easily defeated."
	4 8 3022
		"Succeeded in destroying the Kor Sestor fleet and eliminating the Alpha base on the anarchist world of Zenith. He is very grateful that the bomb or super-weapon, whatever it was, did not need to be used."
	22 8 3022
		"The Kor Sestor drones are still being produced by an automated factory, even though no one is controlling them and they seem to be acting on some sort of mindless autopilot. The Wanderers hope that the Korath exiles will help them to disable the factory."
	4 9 3022
		"Succeeded in communicating with the Korath exiles, by landing on the one habitable planet in their territory. (It seems like the exiles might have a taboo against using weapons on that world.) The exiles agreed to send some ships to help disable the remaining Kor Sestor factory."
	22 9 3022
		"The Korath exiles have kept their bargain with the Wanderers and shut down the final Kor Sestor drone factory, although it may be some time before the last of the existing drones are eliminated."
	8 10 3022
		"Discovered that when the Korath exiles shut down the Kor Sestor factory, they also took enough technology from the factory to be able to begin producing war drones of their own. It is possible that the exiles have just become a whole lot more dangerous than they used to be."
	Factions Arachi
		`The spider-like Arachi were the last of the three Coalition species to discover interstellar travel. Most members of their society owe allegiance to one of the great Arachi "Houses," organizations that are somewhat similar to guilds and that each specialize in one particular form of industry or technology.`
	Factions Archons
		`Archons are partly biological, but do not seem to be naturally evolved creatures. Some of their biological characteristics may have been based on the "void sprites" that inhabit the Ember Waste.`
		"Archons are partly biological, partly technological, and partly something that human language has no words for. They are extremely powerful. The Archons are somehow affiliated with the Drak, yet separate from them."
		"For reasons that are not entirely clear, the Pug are hostile toward the Archons, yet also view them as being worthy of pity."
		"When the Korath civil war reached a point where they had nearly driven themselves extinct, the Drak Archons stepped in and offered the surviving Korath an ultimatum: they must either give up their advanced weaponry and live peaceably under the protection of the Quarg, or be banished to some lifeless star systems near the galactic core. Those who chose banishment apparently took with them the secret of how to build jump drives, which has enabled them to raid other species and steal from them."
	Factions Coalition
		"The Coalition is an alliance of three different alien species living in peace with each other: the Saryds, the Kimek, and the Arachi. On many Coalition worlds, all three species live together in harmony, which is made easier by the fact that each species prefers a very different climate and thus gravitates to different parts of a planet. They are ruled by individuals known as the Heliarchs."
	Factions Drak
		"The Drak are supposedly the oldest living species in the galaxy. The Quarg say that the Drak act as something like galactic peacekeepers or police, and will intervene if a species invents a weapon so terrible that it could drive that species to extinction."
	Factions Heliarchs
		"The Heliarchs are the rulers of Coalitions space: apparently not elected, but instead selected by merit from among the citizens of the Coalition in such a way as to ensure that all three species are equally represented. Thousands of years ago, the Heliarchs led their three species to band together and drive the Quarg out of Coalition space. The Heliarch centers of government are the three Quarg ringworlds that they captured in that war. They are the only ones in Coalition space who are allowed to have weapons on their starships, and they act as a sort of police force, maintaining peace between the Coalition species."
	Factions Kimek
		"The Kimek are large insectoid aliens, and are members of the Coalition. They discovered spaceflight after the Saryds, but before the Arachi. They are intensely social creatures, preferring to live together in massive buildings with thousands of inhabitants, and many of their worlds have populations in the tens of billions, far more than any human world."
	Factions Korath
		`The Korath are reptilian, bipedal aliens whose territory is almost entirely in ruins: cities destroyed and entire planets scarred by what appears to have been a vicious civil war. Several factions of Korath survive. The "Kor Efreti" live in the shelter of a Quarg ringworld and are on peaceful terms with the Quarg. Other Korath, living as exiles near the galactic core, have been raiding human worlds to steal food and supplies. And deeper in Korath space, two massive armies of automated war drones, known as the Kor Mereti and the Kor Sestor, are locked in an unending struggle. They attack any visitors to their region of space, including the Quarg.`
	Factions "Navy Intelligence"
		"It is unclear why the Navy needs their own intelligence force, since the Republic already has a Department of Intelligence that is incredibly powerful and well-funded. Rumors say that one of the main purposes of Navy Intelligence is to watch for human rights abuses being committed by the Republic itself and for other questionable activities that the Department of Intelligence might turn a blind eye toward or even collude with."
	Factions Oathkeepers
		"However, the true reason that the powerful Oathkeeper fleet is positioned in the North is not just to keep the pirates at bay, but also to stand as a last defense in case the Hai decide to invade human space. Apparently the Navy has known about the Hai and the wormhole linking their space to human space for some time, but chooses not to make that knowledge public."
	Factions Pug
		"The Pug are aliens with barrel-shaped bodies, spindly legs, and milky blue blood. They claim to have intervened in the human civil war purely for the sake of preventing more bloodshed and helping humans to live together in peace."
		"It is possible that the Pug secretly assisted the humans of the Deep centuries ago by providing them with weapons that helped to turn the tide of the Alpha Wars."
		"The Quarg claim that the Pug are powerful enough that they could defeat the Quarg, or even the Drak, if they chose to. But the Pug treat warfare like a game. When battling another species, the Pug will limit themselves to ships and weapons that are weak enough that the other species has a chance of defeating them."
		"The Pug disappeared from human space, and left behind more questions than answers. It is possible that the true purpose of their attack was to give human beings a common enemy that would force them to band together and forget their internal struggles."
		`The Pug say that their species is split up into separate groups or "teams" that each focus on interacting with a different sentient species. They view those other species as "projects" that they are working on.`
	Factions Quarg
		"The Quarg are tall, thin, inscrutable aliens who evolved on a very small planet and can live comfortably on worlds with atmosphere so thin that a human being could not breathe it. They discovered spaceflight millions of years ago. Many of them live on artificially constructed ringworlds, including one in human space. They live at peace with most sentient species and claim to be in communication with an even older species named the Drak."
	Factions Remnant
		"Half a millennium ago, during the Alpha Wars, a group of humans fleeing the conflict and looking for a safer place to live discovered a wormhole into a region of space known as the Ember Waste. They built settlements there, and chose to call themselves the Remnant. Although they no longer fear the Alphas as much as they once did, they still have not rejoined human society."
		"Since their colonies were first formed, the Remnant's culture has changed drastically. They communicate in sign language, using their voices only for singing. Their food and architecture and much of their technology is strange, and much of it has been borrowed or stolen from nearby alien species."
		"Recently, Korath ships have begun raiding Remnant worlds. The Remnant have decided not to try to discourage these raids, because they are a perfect opportunity to steal jump drives and other valuable alien technology from the Korath."
	Factions Saryds
		"Saryds are an alien species who look suspiciously similar to the centaurs found in early human mythology. They prefer to live on worlds with as much green space as possible, and even their major cities are full of parks and gardens. Most Saryds live in small communes with up to a few dozen of them per house."
	Factions Sheragi
		`The Unfettered Hai say that a dragon-like species called the "Sheragi" who are long extinct used to live in human space, back when much of what is now human territory was occupied by the Hai.`
		"Recent archaeological discoveries on Zug, a planet in the southern rim of human space, have turned up evidence of a lost alien civilization. The Quarg say that the ruins were left behind by a species called the Sheragi."
	Factions "Unfettered Hai"
		`The "Unfettered" are a faction within the Hai species who are not as peaceful as the rest, and are normally not friendly toward humans. They claim that long ago the Drak altered the Hai to make them docile and peaceful, and that the Unfettered are descendants of those Hai who avoided undergoing that alteration. They are seeking jump drives so that they can escape the "prison" they are now stuck in: a few deteriorating worlds on the far northern edge of Hai space.`
	Factions "Void Sprites"
		`The "void sprites" are space-dwelling lifeforms. They are apparently not sentient. They evolved in the atmosphere of a gas giant, but have some biological mechanism for altering or reflecting gravity that allows them to fly into outer space, in the same way that human ships use antigravity to escape a planet's gravity well. The void sprites are not particularly powerful or dangerous creatures, but they are guarded by a Drak Archon.`
	Factions Wanderers
		`The Wanderers are a bird-like species who inhabit a small region of space adjacent to the Hai. They have been under attack by the "Unfettered" Hai for some time. The Wanderers claim to be peaceful, and most of their ships are not designed for military use.`
		`The Wanderers believe that their purpose in the universe is to "repair" planets whose biospheres have been ravaged by other species either through mismanagement or as a result of war. They came to their current territory through a wormhole that they call "the Eye," and they say that once their work here is done the Eye will open and lead them to a new territory and new worlds for them to care for.`
		"It is possible that the worlds they currently inhabit were formerly part of Hai territory. That might explain why the Unfettered believe they have a right to take that territory back."
		"According to the Quarg, the Wanderers are not native to this galaxy, but were brought here from somehwere else (presumably by the Pug)."
	People "Ektasi Rek"
		"Ektasi Rek is the first Wanderer in millennia to undergo the Molt, changing into a completely different species with new capabilities. As more Wanderers go through the Molt, the Wanderers as a whole will have to decide which of these mutations represents the best way for their species to survive and flourish in Korath space."
		"Rek's Molt has given her enhanced ability not only to understand alien speech, but to mimic the sound of it as well."
	People "Elias Hanover"
		"Elias has been living with the Quarg in Hai space for a long time, and they trust him enough to give him access to some of their restricted technology."
		"Certain Navy officers believe that Elias may actually be more than five centuries old, and that he may be a genetically modified individual, perhaps specifically designed to have capabilities similar to the Alphas so that he can fight against them."
	People "Iktat Rek"
		"Rek is a Wanderer ambassador, a new and unusual profession among a species that until recently has had no contact with aliens except for the occasional Unfettered Hai raid. His job is to help the Wanderers develop a deeper relationship with humans."
		`Rek underwent the Molt, a mysterious process in which the body of a Wanderer who is exposed to novel stimuli transforms into a completely new species while still maintaining that individual's memories and personality. The new Rek is a female and goes by the name "Ektasi Rek."`
	People "Meto Pa'aret"
		`Pa'aret runs a Wanderer artificial intelligence laboratory. He is in charge of the effort to establish a connection between the Wanderers and the Kor Mereti collective by introducing a Wanderer "artificial Mind" into the collective.`
	People Raven
		"Raven, whose full name is unknown, is a Questioner who works for Navy Intelligence. Through some combination of training and natural ability, she is able to reliably detect whether or not someone is telling the truth."
	People Sayari
		"Ambassador Sayari, a Hai, served as their envoy to the human government a century ago (although no public records of this exist in human space). She has now been assigned by the Hai to be their diplomat to the Wanderers, and to serve as a translator as well."
	People "Sobari Tele'ek"
		"Tele'ek is a Wanderer military commander. It is not clear what his rank is or whether or not the Wanderer military is even organized enough for individuals to have ranks, but he has been placed in charge of holding back the Hai while the remaining Wanderer worlds near the front are evacuated."
		"Tele'ek became part of the expeditionary force that was formed to explore the territory beyond the Eye once it opened."
	People "Tema'a Iriket"
		"Iriket is a Wanderer specializing in terraforming, who has been selected to survey the worlds beyond the Eye and to make plans for how each one can be made to flourish once more. She is far more interested in the terraforming work than in dealing with the threat of the Korath war machines."
