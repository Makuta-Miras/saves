		description "Ingot is a volcanic moon, totally unsuitable for life but rich in metal. The miners who work here must spend all their time inside pressurized buildings. Because Ingot has almost no atmosphere to slow them down, meteorites are a constant danger to the colonists. The shells of the buildings have multiple layers, designed to be self-sealing in any but the largest of impacts. Most of the mining is done remotely by robotic vehicles, but someone still needs to be present to control them and to make repairs when something goes wrong."

It is dangerous work: the mines are deep underground and prone to noxious gases and cave-ins, and the refineries work with molten radioactive materials and caustic chemicals. Due to the somewhat dim light of the star Algorel, and the cloudiness of the atmosphere, this is not a good world for farming, and the population remains quite small."

It is, however, the best source of heavy metals in the galactic south. Aside from the managers of the mining companies, nearly all the people here are migrant workers from elsewhere in the Dirt Belt, who have come to spend a season working for the relatively high wages that uranium mining offers, either to send money off-world or to save it up in order to build a better life for themselves."

	planet Clink
		description "About a decade ago, a mining corporation from Zug planted a colony on Clink for harvesting some rare earth minerals that are present in this moon's crust due to its unusually high rate of asteroid impacts. The atmosphere here is too thin to breathe without a respirator, and because of the low gravity, the dust raised by the mining operations hangs perpetually in the air."
		description "The miners who work here are a tight-knit group, since most of them were part of the original colonization team. They are not particularly open to outsiders, and the facilities here are so rudimentary that they do not even stock fuel for visiting ships."

	planet Deep
		spaceport "The spaceport is built on a large island, a now-extinct volcano with an elevation of several kilometers at its center. Most of the large-scale fishing here is done by a single company, Poseidon Industries, who also built and maintain the spaceport. Steep winding roads and sturdy cement homes and warehouses line the mountain slopes, and below you in the harbor several massive trawling vessels are moored. On the outskirts of the spaceport are the ramshackle houses and open-air marketplace used by the smaller, independent fishing families."

	planet Thule
		description "Thule is a mountainous world with a population of nearly a billion, settled in the early days of space exploration. When the colony was first established, the Earth government did not yet have the strength to control any system but its own, and when the Republic was formed, Thule did not join, and has repulsed all efforts to force them to do so."
		description "	Until recently, Thule was a well-known den of pirate activity, but the major tribal authorities have now forsworn piracy in the interest of keeping the Free Worlds from further meddling in their affairs. However, it is likely that all manner of illegal activity is still going on in secret here."
	planet "Smuggler's Den"
		description "Smuggler's Den was formerly known as Grendel Station, back when it was an operating refinery. After that, it was taken over by pirates, and became a haven for all manner of smugglers and privateers. Now, at least in theory it is an independent station, no longer allied with the pirates. In practice, you suspect a fair amount of piracy still goes on here."
		description "The repair shops here can make a variety of legal and illegal modifications to your ship, and in the shipyard you can buy refurbished starships... if it does not trouble your conscience to think about the likely fates of their previous owners."
		spaceport "It is a strange but indisputable fact that anarchists smell worse than ordinary human beings. In this day and age, where even the cheapest shuttlecraft at least has a sonic shower, there is no logical explanation for it, except that anarchist tendencies must somehow go hand in hand with a tendency to reject society's norms around hygiene. Here in a space station, with nothing but recycled air to breathe, the effect is overpowering."

		description "	Recently, with the help of the Free Worlds, a new spaceport was completed here. Bloodsea was formerly a pirate world, but the new spaceport has given it an air of respectability, and already a small number of settlers and curious tourists have begun flowing in."
		spaceport "The new spaceport is impressively well designed, with seawalls and landing pads of crisp, newly-set concrete, still unmarked by weather or mildew. It is also several times larger than necessary for the number of people and ships that are here, and aside from a lively market, it feels strangely empty."
		spaceport `	Some things remain unchanged from back in the pirate days. The local slang incorporates threats of extreme violence as a seemingly meaningless verbal tic. "Hey, I'm gonna cut off your fingers one by one until you buy a meat patty!" a vendor calls out cheerfully as you pass. "First one's free, and I'll tie a knot in your spine if you don't like it."`

		description "Geminus, although not the most hospitable of worlds, is a young enough planet that large stores of iron, titanium, and other metals are easily accessible near the surface. The constant volcanic activity leaves the planet perpetually shrouded in a twilight haze of ash and fog."
		description "	The shattered remnants of the old Navy Yard are still left abandoned and slowly rusting away in the planet's caustic atmosphere, but the Republic has now built a new shipyard to replace the one destroyed in the bombing, and once again Geminus has become a central hub of technology and industry."
		spaceport "Like everything else on Geminus, the spaceport is not terribly pretty, but is functional and efficient. Each of the wide hallways is marked out like a road, with space in the center for electric carts carrying cargo, while pedestrians are relegated to the edges. Video cameras and sensors have been placed at every intersection, and access to the shipbuilding facilities is tightly controlled."
		spaceport "	The hub of the spaceport is a food court with a ring of shops in the center and seating on the outside, where you can look out of plate glass windows at the lava fields and caldera outside. By night, you can see the volcanic glow all around the horizon."

The Wanderers did not have time to demolish any of their equipment or to carry it off-world before the planet was lost. As a result, they have given the Unfettered a significant technological advantage here."

		description "The Wanderers worked for years to make this desert world bloom: planting hardy shrubs and cacti that eventually transform the sand into a soil that can hold moisture. In some regions, especially closer to the poles, the deserts have given way to dense forests, but near the equator there are still large stretches of dry and barren sand, broken by the occasional belt of green where a narrow river winds between the dunes."
		description "	Now that the Unfettered have taken over control of the planet, it may be only a matter of time before the deserts dominate it once again."
		spaceport "The spaceport is in a forest village near the planet's north pole. The landing pads are massive stone monoliths laid on the ground in a nearby clearing. But aside from a few large warehouses at ground level, the village itself is entirely made of tree-houses. Although they are very different from Hai architecture, the Unfettered seem to be quite at home living in the tree-houses, and have not built many of their own structures yet."

		attributes unfettered urban farming
		description "Of all the worlds that the Unfettered have captured, this is surely the one that the Wanderers will miss the most: a heavily forested planet that was once home to countless small villages and even a few cities. The Unfettered are clearly doing their best to tend the farms here, but they operate on a permaculture system that relies heavily on maintaining a delicate ecological balance, rather than on machines and pesticides."
		spaceport "A large number of Unfettered settlers have already arrived here and begun setting up a spaceport village, complete with markets, taverns, and military barracks. To the Unfettered, who have lived their whole lives on worlds where the local ecology is in shambles, this planet must seem like a paradise."

		description "This is a relatively dry planet, and the only Korath cities were close to the poles where the temperatures are more mild and the lifeless deserts give way to grasslands and even a few scattered forests. The largest city was clearly destroyed by orbital bombardment. The other cities seem to have been done in by rioting or looting, leaving smashed windows and burned-out buildings behind. Some of the damage is very recent; the Korath survivors here held out for a long time."
		description "	Hidden deep in a canyon, the Wanderers have begun establishing a military base here."
		spaceport "The Wanderers have hollowed out hangars and caves in the soft sandstone walls of this canyon and have begun to build a military base where they can store supplies and repair their ships while trying to decide how best to deal with the new challenges that face them in Korath space."
		spaceport "	Oddly enough, they have also found enough time to plant a large garden on a terrace near the base of the canyon, where they are experimenting to find out which plant species will best grow in this arid environment. The Wanderer drive to understand and transform the local ecology is strong, indeed."

		description "New Asgard is a relatively small moon, although despite this it is still able to hold onto a thick, breathable atmosphere. Much of the moon is desert, although some areas near the highest mountains do receive enough rain to allow them to become well-forested. The oceans here have enormous tide differences due to the gas giant above, and as a result, most seaside settlements are practically built inside glass domes reinforced with titanium so that they can survive the inrush of water at high tide."
		description "	Despite the relative absence of natural resources, New Asgard is still fairly rich due to the tourism industry- many people come here simply to experience the awe of waking up to see the face of a gas giant staring down at them."
		spaceport "The spaceport is a slick, clean and modern, with hallways paved in dark granite and arching roofs overhead. Most of the terminal is taken up by small stores and off-licenses."

		description `As with the planet below, Bilbo was named after a character from 'The Lord of the Rings'. This time, however, this moon was named "Bilbo" due to its odd similarity to the far eastern areas of Middle-Earth, to which the moon's namesake travelled during The Lord of the Rings' prequel. As a result, much of the terrain is tough and mountainous- perfectly suited to the dwarves of fantasy legend.`

	planet Memorandum
		description `Memorandum is a very "normal" world. The climate is stable and fairly warm, and days are similar to those on Earth.

		description "Plumes of soot and ash rise from a cluster of several dozen volcanoes on this planet's main continent, shrouding the planet in a thick layer of clouds and choking out the sunlight. The ruins of several Korath cities and the geometric grids of cleared land surrounding them show that this was once a farming world, but now few plants are able to survive and kilometer-high glaciers have begun creeping down from the poles."

		spaceport "This odd settlement was built half by the Wanderers and half by the Mereti drones. The layout of the streets is completely chaotic, and they have planted rows of trees and bushes everywhere: some inside greenhouses, and some hardier species out in the open air. The settlement is near the equator, but it is still not particularly warm."

Since most of them do not speak each other's language, the two groups do not mingle much, and communicate mostly via gestures and drawings. It's not much, but it's at least a start for the two species to begin learning from each other."

XSZ's largest shipyards were once located here, meaning thousands of people migrated here each year to fill the massive number of jobs required to work in the shipyards, as well as the mines."
		description "	While you hear Storm Crow Industries has plans to salvage some of XSZ's old designs and convert the shipyards here into a new complex for manufacturing their own ships, nothing has happened as of yet. As a result, many families are out of work, with grumblings of discontent common among the populace."
		spaceport "The spaceport is an enormous complex, taking advantage of the massive space afforded by being in an area that has already been exhausted of its raw materials."

	Factions Archons
		`Archons are partly biological, but do not seem to be naturally evolved creatures. Some of their biological characteristics may have been based on the "void sprites" that inhabit the Ember Waste.`

	Factions Remnant
		"Half a millennium ago, during the Alpha Wars, a group of humans fleeing the conflict and looking for a safer place to live discovered a wormhole into a region of space known as the Ember Waste. They built settlements there, and chose to call themselves the Remnant. Although they no longer fear the Alphas as much as they once did, they still have not rejoined human society."
		"Since their colonies were first formed, the Remnant's culture has changed drastically. They communicate in sign language, using their voices only for singing. Their food and architecture and much of their technology is strange, and much of it has been borrowed or stolen from nearby alien species."
		"Recently, Korath ships have begun raiding Remnant worlds. The Remnant have decided not to try to discourage these raids, because they are a perfect opportunity to steal jump drives and other valuable alien technology from the Korath."
	Factions "Void Sprites"
		`The "void sprites" are space-dwelling lifeforms. They are apparently not sentient. They evolved in the atmosphere of a gas giant, but have some biological mechanism for altering or reflecting gravity that allows them to fly into outer space, in the same way that human ships use antigravity to escape a planet's gravity well. The void sprites are not particularly powerful or dangerous creatures, but they are guarded by a Drak Archon.`
